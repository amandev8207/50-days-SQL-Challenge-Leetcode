#1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

Pandas Schema
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct query_name , round(avg(rating/position) over(partition by query_name) ,2) as quality,
round(avg(case when rating<3 then 1 else 0 end) over(partition by query_name)*100,2) as poor_query_percentage from queries
where query_name is not null
