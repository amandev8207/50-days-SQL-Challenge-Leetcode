Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example


# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    visited_on,
    (
        SELECT SUM(amount)
        FROM customer
        WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(
        (
            SELECT SUM(amount) / 7
            FROM customer
            WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
        ),
        2
    ) AS average_amount
FROM customer c
WHERE visited_on >= (
        SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
        FROM customer
    )
GROUP BY visited_on;
